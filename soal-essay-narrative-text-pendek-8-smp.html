He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby. So, when the farmer came out the next day, you know what he found in the swan's nest? Nothing.<br />Moral: People who always want more frequent sometimes lose everything. If you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you may lose what you already have.<br /><br />atau<br /><br />A Wolf and Dog<br />Once upon a time there was a wolf who nearly died of starvation. He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />

Taking a few steps backward, the fox jumped but unfortunately he missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces backward, ran, and tried to reach them but he still failed.<br /><br />Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, “They’re probably sour anyway,” and proceeded to walk away.<br /><br />Moral Value: it’s easy to despise what you cannot have.<br /><br />Rubah dan Anggur<br /><br />Pada suatu sore ada seekor rubah yang sedang berjalan melalui hutan dan melihat sekelompok anggur tergantung di cabang yang tinggi.

One day I had visited a restaurant in Cibubur - western Java

known in the area cibubur . The restaurant is so simple , with shades of green
that looks cool , Sundanese music sounded melodious , not forgetting also the
seat that is so unique .

    The restaurant was called " Bebek
Cabe Ijo" , this restaurant offers a wide variety of processed duck like :
Bebek bakar  asam manis, ungkep bebek ,
gulai bebek , bebek goreng and do not forget there is also a variety of sauteed
vegetables unappetizing .

every dish we ordered was always presented green chili sauce
that I think it is so delicious , but there are also others such as sambal :
mango sauce , chili paste , and sambal other .

    at the time I ordered sweet and sour
roasted duck sauce 2 ie : green chili sauce and mango sauce ,pencak kangkung, tempe
and tahu, as well as a glass of orange ice is so fresh .

waiters there are so friendly , they even wear clothes that
are so funny, so I laugh when I see clothes that they use , easy green shirt
bearing the name of the restaurant and the duck picture is so great , and the
men using blankon playan unique .

there ducks prices were pretty reasonable guess about 25rb
on 1potong duck , it rekomended once pokonya restaurant to visit.

if there is time I would like to once again visit the
restaurant because I miss the food that was there .dah segitu aja,karna aku pernah<br /><br />

                        The Bear and The Two Friends<br />Once two friends were walking through the forest. They knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would remain united in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear approaching them. One of the friends at once climbed a nearby tree. But the other one did not know how to climb. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place. Because the bears do not touch the dead creatures.Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend.”<br />

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers. He was ugly.<br />2.No, he did not. He did not want to play with the ugly duckling.<br />3.Because he was unhappy that his brothers did not want to play with him, he was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals simply laughed at him so he felt sad and lonely.<br />4.The old woman<br />5.The hen was frightening the ugly duckling that if he did not lay egg the old woman would cook him.<br />6.The farmer and his children took care of the duckling well.<br />7.The young swan was the ugly duckling.<br />8.The ugly duckling, Mother Duck, the od woman, the hen, the farmer and his children, the swans.<br /><br />sry klo kepanjangan :v<br />

                        Example of a narrative text :<br />         <br /><br />                                                     True Friends<br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />
